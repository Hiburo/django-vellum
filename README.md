django-vellum
=============

A [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) web log application.


Genesis
-------

This application began life as part of [Nathan Borror](http://nathanborror.com/)'s [django-basic-apps](https://github.com/nathanborror/django-basic-apps), a collection of simple prebuilt Django applications.

When I first decided I wanted to move to a Django-based blog, I looked around to see if there were any existing projects I could use. There was certainly no shortage of blog applications, but none of them were exactly what I was looking for. Nathan's basic blog was close, but, as the name implies, very basic. [Kevin Fricovsky](http://montylounge.com/)'s [django-mingus](https://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus), which is itself built on top of Nathan's basic blog, appealed to me the most, but still had aspects that I did not like. So I decided to create my own.

In true open source fashion, I forked django-basic-apps. It provided an excellent framework to work from -- had I started from scratch, I would have ended up recreating a lot of what Nathan had already done. With that fork, along with some ideas inspired by django-mingus and Wordpress, I was able to craft a blog application that suited me perfectly. I think it's pretty nice -- and it turns out it suits some other people pretty well, too!

The only thing I did not like about it was that the blog was part of a larger collection of Django applications, most of which I did not use. I am happy to put my name on the blog, but I did not want to maintain or vouch for the numerous other apps. So, I spun off the two other applications that I did use ([django-media](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-media) and [django-inlines](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-inlines)), deleted the rest, and renamed the blog.

Thus, django-[vellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellum).


Features
--------


### Wordpress Import

A management script is included to import blog posts from a Wordpress-generated XML file. For more information, run `./manage.py wordpress_import`.


### Disqus

[Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments are supported (and recommended).


### Auto-Excerpts

An author can manually specify content to use as the excerpt or tease of a post. If they choose not to do this, auto excerpts can be enabled to automatically truncate a post after a certain number of characters and use that as the post excerpt.


### Markup

Posts can be written in traditional HTML, plaintext, or any number of markup languages ([Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is recommended).

If Markdown is used, an enjoyable writing experience is provided by [django-wmd](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-wmd/).
